## Your First TypeScript Program
This page will guide you through creating and compiling a simple "Hello, World!" program using TypeScript. By the end of this page, you will have a basic understanding of how to set up a TypeScript file, compile it into JavaScript, and run the compiled code.

### Creating a TypeScript File
To create your first TypeScript program, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new folder called hello, and in it a file called `hello.ts`.

3. In the `hello.ts` file, write the following code:

   ```typescript
   const message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
   console.log(message);
   ```

   In this code, we declare a constant variable `message` of type `string` and assign it the value `'Hello, TypeScript!'`. We then use `console.log()` to print the message to the console.

### Compiling TypeScript into JavaScript
TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be executed. Follow these steps to compile your TypeScript file:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your `hello.ts` file is located.

3. Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) followed by the name of your TypeScript file:

   ```shell
   tsc hello.ts
   ```

   This command instructs the TypeScript compiler to compile `hello.ts` into JavaScript. The compiled JavaScript file (`hello.js`) will be generated in the same directory.

### Running the Compiled JavaScript
Once your TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript, you can run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js. Follow these steps to execute your program:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your `hello.js` file is located.

2. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

   ```shell
   node hello.js
   ```

   This command executes the compiled JavaScript code and displays the output in the console:

   ```
   Hello, TypeScript!
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully created, compiled, and executed your first TypeScript program.
