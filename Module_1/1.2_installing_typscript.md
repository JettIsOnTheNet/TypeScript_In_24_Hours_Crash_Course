## Getting Started

To start programming in TypeScript, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a brief guide to get you started:

1. **Install Node.js**: TypeScript requires Node.js to run. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to install Node.js on your machine.

2. **Install TypeScript**: Once you have Node.js installed, open your command line and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

   ```shell
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   This will install the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) that we'll use to transpile our TypeScript code into JavaScript.

3. **Choose an Editor**: You can write TypeScript code in any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and WebStorm. Choose the editor that you're comfortable with or explore new ones to find the best fit for you.

4. **Create a TypeScript Project**: Now that you have everything set up, create a new folder for your TypeScript project.
