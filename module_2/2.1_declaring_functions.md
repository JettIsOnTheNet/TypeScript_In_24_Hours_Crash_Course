## Declaring Functions

In TypeScript, functions are an essential part of the language, allowing you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. They enable you to organize and structure your code for improved maintainability and reusability. In this module, we will explore the various aspects of declaring functions in TypeScript.

### Function Declarations

To declare a function in TypeScript, you can use the `function` keyword followed by the function name, a set of parentheses for parameters (optional), and curly braces `{}` to define the function body. Here's an example of a simple function declaration:

```typescript
function hello(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

In the example above, we declared a function named `hello` that takes a single parameter `name` of type `string`. The function body logs a greeting message to the console, utilizing the parameter.

### Function Expressions

In TypeScript, you can also declare functions using function expressions. Function expressions assign functions to variables, allowing them to be passed around as values.

```typescript
const multiply = function (a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
};
```

In the example above, we assigned an anonymous function to the variable `multiply`. The function takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `number` and returns their product.

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for declaring functions and are particularly useful for short, one-line functions. They also capture the `this` value of the enclosing context automatically.

```typescript
const square = (num: number): number => num * num;
```

In the example above, we declared an arrow function assigned to the variable `square`. The function takes a parameter `num` of type `number` and returns the square of the number.
