# Function Overloading

Function overloading is a powerful feature in TypeScript that allows you to define multiple function signatures for a single function name. Each signature can have a different number of parameters and types. When you call an overloaded function, TypeScript uses type inference to determine the appropriate signature based on the provided arguments.

## How Function Overloading Works

In TypeScript, function overloading is achieved by declaring multiple function signatures using the same function name. The list of signatures is followed by a single implementation that handles all the possible cases.

Example:

```typescript
// Function signature 1: Accepts two numbers and returns their sum
function add(a: number, b: number): number;

// Function signature 2: Accepts two strings and concatenates them
function add(a: string, b: string): string;

// Implementation for both signatures
function add(a: number | string, b: number | string): number | string {
  if (typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number') {
    return a + b;
  } else if (typeof a === 'string' && typeof b === 'string') {
    return a.concat(b);
  }
}
```

In this example, we have two function signatures for the `add` functionâ€”one for numbers and another for strings. The implementation handles both cases by checking the types of the arguments and performing the appropriate operation.

## Benefits of Function Overloading

Function overloading provides several benefits:

1. **Type Safety**: Overloaded functions help enforce type safety by allowing you to specify different types for different input and output combinations. The TypeScript compiler can catch potential type errors during development.

2. **Readability**: Function overloading enhances code readability as it allows you to define multiple related functions under the same name, making the API more intuitive and easier to understand.

3. **Maintainability**: By grouping similar functionalities under a single function name, it becomes easier to maintain and update the codebase.

## Limitations

While function overloading is a useful feature, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

1. **Single Implementation**: All function signatures share the same implementation. It's the developer's responsibility to ensure that the implementation handles all possible combinations correctly.

2. **Order of Signatures**: The order of function signatures matters. TypeScript will use the first matching signature it encounters during type inference. So, it's crucial to order the signatures properly to avoid unexpected behavior.

3. **Ambiguity**: Sometimes, TypeScript may not be able to determine the correct signature, resulting in ambiguous function calls. In such cases, it's necessary to add additional type guards or refactor the function signatures to make them more distinct.

## Notes

Function overloading is a powerful tool in TypeScript that allows you to define multiple function signatures with different input and output types under the same function name. It enhances code readability, type safety, and maintainability. However, you should be mindful of the limitations while implementing overloaded functions.
