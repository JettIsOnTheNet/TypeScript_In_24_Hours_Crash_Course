# Module 2 Project: Functional Hello

In this project, we will create a very simple TypeScript project consisting of a single TypeScript file named `functional_hello.ts`. The objective is to declare a function called `functional_hello` that takes user input and outputs a personalized greeting.

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, you need to have TypeScript installed on your system. If you do not, or do not remember how, please reference [Module 1.2 Installing TypeScript](../module_1/1.2_installing_typescript.md).

## Project Setup

1. Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir module_2_project
cd module_2_project
```

## Implementation: functional_hello.ts

Create a file called `functional_hello.ts` in your favorite code editor in your module_2_project directory and add the following code:

```typescript
// Function to read user input from the terminal
function getUserInput(question: string): Promise<string> {
  const readline = require('readline');
  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout,
  });

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    rl.question(question, (input) => {
      rl.close();
      resolve(input);
    });
  });
}

// Function to greet the user
function functional_hello(username: string) {
  console.log(`Hello ${username}!`);
}

// Main function to initiate the program
async function main() {
  const username = await getUserInput('Enter your name: ');
  functional_hello(username);
}

// Call the main function to start the program
main();
```

## How the Project Works

1. We create a function named `getUserInput` to handle user input. It uses Node.js's `readline` module to read input from the terminal and returns a Promise that resolves with the user's input.

2. We declare a function called `functional_hello` that takes a `username` parameter and outputs a personalized greeting using the `console.log()` function.

3. We create a `main` function that uses `await` to call the `getUserInput` function and stores the user's input in the `username` variable.

4. The `main` function then calls the `functional_hello` function with the `username` to display the greeting.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you need to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and then execute it.

1. Compile the TypeScript code:

```bash
tsc functional_hello.ts
```

This will generate a JavaScript file named `functional_hello.js`.

2. Run the project:

```bash
node functional_hello.js
```

The program will then ask you for your name, and the it will greet you with a personalized message.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a very simple TypeScript project that takes user input and outputs a personalized greeting. This project demonstrates how to read user input from the terminal without using the `readline` method directly. Feel free to build upon this project and explore more complex TypeScript applications!
