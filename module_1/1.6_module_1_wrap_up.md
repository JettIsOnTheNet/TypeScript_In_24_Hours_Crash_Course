# Congratulations on completing Module 1: Introduction to TypeScript! 

In this module, you learned the fundamental concepts and tools necessary to start working with TypeScript. 

## Let's recap what you covered:

- Introduction to TypeScript: You gained an understanding of what TypeScript is and how it relates to JavaScript. TypeScript brings static typing, enhanced tooling, and other features to help build scalable and maintainable applications.

- Getting Started: You explored the steps to set up TypeScript in your development environment. This included installing TypeScript, configuring the TypeScript compiler options, and setting up a basic TypeScript file.

- Setting up a TypeScript Project: You learned about organizing your TypeScript code into projects and managing dependencies using package managers like npm. You also discovered how to use TypeScript configuration files to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.

- Basic Types and Variables: You dove into the basic types available in TypeScript and how to declare and use variables of different types. You covered boolean, number, string, array, tuple, enum, any, and void types. You also learned about variable declarations using the let and const keywords, as well as the concept of type inference.

- Your First TypeScript Program: You built your very first program! hello.ts! It may be a very simple program, but everyone learns to run by putting one foot in front of the other and you just took your first step! By the end you will be making much more complex applications.

## Continued Learning:

In the upcoming modules, we will continue exploring TypeScript and delve into more advanced topics such as functions, classes, interfaces, modules, and TypeScript's type system features. These concepts will empower you to build robust and scalable applications using TypeScript.

Take some time to reinforce your understanding of the topics covered in this module and take the remainder of this hour to practicing writing TypeScript code and experimenting with different types and variables. Remember to refer back to the module materials whenever you need a quick refresher.

Great job on completing Module 1, and get ready to continue your TypeScript journey in Module 2!
