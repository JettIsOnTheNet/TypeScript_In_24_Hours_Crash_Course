## Basic Types and Variables in TypeScript

### Introduction
In TypeScript, like in any programming language, variables are used to store and manipulate data. However, TypeScript provides additional features such as static typing, which allows for the declaration of types for variables. This page will introduce you to the basic types available in TypeScript and how to declare and use variables of different types.

### Types in TypeScript
TypeScript includes several built-in types that you can use to declare variables. These types include:

1. **Boolean**: The boolean type represents logical values - either `true` or `false`. You can declare a boolean variable as follows:

   ```typescript
   let isDone: boolean = false;
   ```

2. **Number**: The number type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. You can declare a number variable as follows:

   ```typescript
   let count: number = 42;
   ```

3. **String**: The string type represents textual data. You can declare a string variable using single quotes or double quotes:

   ```typescript
   let message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
   ```

4. **Array**: The array type represents an ordered list of elements of a specific type. You can declare an array variable by appending `[]` to the type:

   ```typescript
   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the generic `Array` type:

   ```typescript
   let names: Array<string> = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
   ```

5. **Tuple**: A tuple is an array-like structure where each element can have a different type. You can declare a tuple by specifying the types of its elements in a specific order:

   ```typescript
   let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 25];
   ```

6. **Enum**: An enum is a way to define a set of named constants. You can declare an enum using the `enum` keyword:

   ```typescript
   enum Color {
     Red,
     Green,
     Blue,
   }

   let favoriteColor: Color = Color.Blue;
   ```

7. **Any**: The any type represents a variable that can hold values of any type. It allows for flexibility but loses the benefits of static typing:

   ```typescript
   let dynamicValue: any = 42;
   dynamicValue = 'Hello!';
   ```

8. **Void**: The void type is used to indicate the absence of a value. Typically used as the return type of functions that do not return a value:

   ```typescript
   function logMessage(): void {
     console.log('This is a log message.');
   }
   ```

### Variable Declarations
To declare a variable in TypeScript, you can use the `let` keyword followed by the variable name and its type (optional):

```typescript
let name: string = 'Alice';
```

You can also use the `const` keyword to declare constants:

```typescript
const PI: number = 3.14;
```

### Type Inference
TypeScript also supports type inference, which means the type of a variable can be automatically determined based on its initial value. For example:

```typescript
let age = 25; // TypeScript infers `age` as type `number`
```

### Wrap Up
Understanding basic types and variable declarations is crucial for writing TypeScript code. By using proper types, you can catch errors early and improve code readability and maintainability.
