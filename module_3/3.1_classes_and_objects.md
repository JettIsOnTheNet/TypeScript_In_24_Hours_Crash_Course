# Classes and Objects

## Objects

In the first chapter we covered data types and variables, but one data type we did not cover is the "object". An object is a data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a Symbol) and each value can have any valid TypeScript data type. 

### Example: 
Lets say we have 2 customers at a shoe store. Bob is age 30, and wears purple sneakers. Imani is age 26, and wears red sneakers. How do you store the data related to both of these people?

You could create 2 arrays, one for Bob and one for Imani, or you could relationally store keys that contain values to 'red' or 'purple'. However manipulating this data can easily become unwieldy quickly. Wouldn't it be easier to define a specification for "customer", where age and sneaker color preference are easily storable and accessible?

Objects allow you to store related data and functions together, making it a fundamental construct in JavaScript and TypeScript.

An object in TypeScript is defined using curly braces `{}` and follows a specific syntax for declaring its properties and methods:

```typescript
// Example of an object in TypeScript
const customer = {
    name: 'Imani',
    age: 26,
    colorPreference: 'red',
    printCustomer: function () {
        console.log(`Customer ${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and likes sneakers in ${this.colorPreference}.`);
    },
};
```

In this example, we have an object `customer` with four properties: `name`, `age`, and `colorPreference`, which are of type `string` and `printCustomer`, which is a method (a function attached to the object). The `this` keyword inside the `printCustomer` method refers back to the current object instance, allowing us to easily access its properties.

TypeScript's type system allows you to define the shape of an object explicitly using interfaces or types. This provides better code safety and enables code editors to provide type-checking support. Here's how you can define the type of the `customer` object explicitly:

```typescript
interface Customer {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    colorPreference: string;
    printCustomer: () => void;
}

const customer: Customer = {
    name: 'Amahau',
    age: 36,
    colorPreference: 'green',
    printCustomer: function () {
        console.log(`Customer ${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and likes sneakers in ${this.colorPreference}.`);
    },
};
```

By defining the `Customer` interface, we create a blueprint to specify the required properties and methods for objects of type `Customer`. Now, any object assigned to a variable of type `Customer` must adhere to this interface's structure.

Object properties can also be accessed and modified using dot notation or square bracket notation:

```typescript
console.log(customer.name); // Output: "Garreth"
console.log(customer['age']); // Output: 19

customer.colorPreference // Value: magenta
customer.colorPreference = 'aqua'; // Modify colorPreference property

customer.printCustomer(); // Output: Customer Garreth is 19 years old and likes sneakers in aqua.
```

Understanding objects is essential for effective TypeScript development and object-oriented programming.

## Classes

In TypeScript, classes provide a way to define structures for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. A class serves as a template or constructor for objects, encapsulating data and methods within its scope. Creating classes is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and TypeScript enhances this feature with its strong static typing capabilities.

To define a class in TypeScript, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Here's a basic example of how to create a class:

```typescript
// Define a simple class
class Customer {
    // Class properties
    name: string;
    age: number;

    // Constructor
    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Class method
    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we've created a class called `Customer`. This class has two properties, `name` and `age`, which are of types `string` and `number`, respectively. We've also defined a constructor using the `constructor` keyword. The constructor is a special method that gets executed when you create a new instance of the class. It allows us to initialize the class properties when the object is created.

To create an instance of the `Customer` class, you use the `new` keyword, and you can pass arguments to the constructor to set the initial values of the class properties:

```typescript
// Create an instance of the Customer class
const customer1 = new Customer('Haruki', 30);
const customer2 = new Customer('Charlotte', 25);

// Call the class method
customer1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Haruki and I am 30 years old.
customer2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Charlotte and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example, we've created two instances of the `Customer` class, `customer1` and `customer2`, each with different values for the `name` and `age` properties.

By creating classes, you can easily define and manage objects with shared characteristics and behaviors, promoting code reusability and organization. As you gain more TypeScript knowledge, you'll be able to explore more advanced class features, inheritance, and other object-oriented programming principles.
