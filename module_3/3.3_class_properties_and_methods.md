# Class Properties and Methods

In TypeScript, class properties and methods are essential components of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects with shared characteristics and behaviors. Class properties represent the data members of the class, while class methods are functions that operate on these properties. Understanding how to define and work with class properties and methods is crucial for building robust and organized TypeScript applications.

## Class Properties

Class properties are variables declared within the class that hold data specific to each instance of the class. These properties define the state of the object and are accessible through the instance of the class. To declare a class property, you simply define the variable within the class scope.

Here's an example of a class with properties related to cooking ingredients:

```typescript
class Ingredient {
    // Class properties
    name: string;
    quantity: number;
    unit: string;

    // Constructor to initialize properties
    constructor(name: string, quantity: number, unit: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.unit = unit;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Ingredient` class has three properties: `name`, `quantity`, and `unit`, representing different aspects of a cooking ingredient. The constructor initializes these properties when a new instance of the `Ingredient` class is created.

## Class Methods

Class methods are functions defined within the class that operate on the class properties. These methods can perform various operations, modify the state of the object, or provide some functionality related to the class.

Let's add a class method to the `Ingredient` class that allows us to display information about the ingredient:

```typescript
class Ingredient {
    // Class properties
    name: string;
    quantity: number;
    unit: string;

    // Constructor to initialize properties
    constructor(name: string, quantity: number, unit: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.unit = unit;
    }

    // Class method to display information about the ingredient
    displayInfo() {
        console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.quantity} ${this.unit}`);
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we've added the `displayInfo()` method to the `Ingredient` class. When called on an instance of the class, this method will output information about the ingredient, including its name, quantity, and unit.

## Using Class Properties and Methods

To use class properties and methods, we need to create instances of the class using the `new` keyword:

```typescript
// Create instances of the Ingredient class
const ingredient1 = new Ingredient('Flour', 500, 'g');
const ingredient2 = new Ingredient('Sugar', 250, 'g');

// Access class properties
console.log(ingredient1.name); // Output: "Flour"
console.log(ingredient2.quantity); // Output: 250

// Call class methods
ingredient1.displayInfo(); // Output: Flour: 500 g
ingredient2.displayInfo(); // Output: Sugar: 250 g
```

In this code snippet, we create two instances of the `Ingredient` class, `ingredient1` and `ingredient2`, and access their properties and call the `displayInfo()` method to show information about each ingredient.

Class properties and methods allow us to organize and encapsulate data and functionality within a class, providing a clean and modular approach to object-oriented programming in TypeScript.
