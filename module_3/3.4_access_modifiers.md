# Access Modifiers

In TypeScript, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility of class members (properties and methods) from outside the class. These modifiers provide an important mechanism for encapsulating and restricting access to certain class members, ensuring proper data encapsulation and promoting better code organization and security.

TypeScript supports three main access modifiers:

1. **Public**: The default access modifier for class members. Public members are accessible from anywhere, including outside the class.

2. **Private**: When a member is marked as private, it can only be accessed within the class where it is defined. Private members are not visible from outside the class, including subclasses.

3. **Protected**: Protected members are similar to private members, but they can also be accessed within subclasses (derived classes) of the defining class.

## Usage of Access Modifiers

To apply access modifiers to class members, you place them before the member declaration. Here's how you can use access modifiers in a TypeScript class:

```typescript
class MyClass {
    public publicMember: string;
    private privateMember: number;
    protected protectedMember: boolean;

    constructor(publicMember: string, privateMember: number, protectedMember: boolean) {
        this.publicMember = publicMember;
        this.privateMember = privateMember;
        this.protectedMember = protectedMember;
    }

    public publicMethod() {
        console.log('This is a public method.');
    }

    private privateMethod() {
        console.log('This is a private method.');
    }

    protected protectedMethod() {
        console.log('This is a protected method.');
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a class called `MyClass` with three class members (`publicMember`, `privateMember`, and `protectedMember`) and three class methods (`publicMethod()`, `privateMethod()`, and `protectedMethod()`). Each member and method is assigned a different access modifier to control its visibility.

## Accessing Class Members

Now, let's create an instance of the `MyClass` and observe how the access modifiers affect the accessibility of its members:

```typescript
const myInstance = new MyClass('Public', 86, true);

console.log(myInstance.publicMember); // Output: "Public"
console.log(myInstance.privateMember); // Error: Property 'privateMember' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.
console.log(myInstance.protectedMember); // Error: Property 'protectedMember' is protected and only accessible within class 'MyClass' and its subclasses.

myInstance.publicMethod(); // Output: "This is a public method."
myInstance.privateMethod(); // Error: Property 'privateMethod' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.
myInstance.protectedMethod(); // Error: Property 'protectedMethod' is protected and only accessible within class 'MyClass' and its subclasses.
```

In this code, we can access the `publicMember` and `publicMethod()` from outside the class because they are marked as public. However, attempting to access `privateMember`, `privateMethod()`, `protectedMember`, and `protectedMethod()` from outside the class results in errors due to their corresponding access modifiers.

## Benefits of Access Modifiers

Access modifiers help to enforce encapsulation and data hiding, ensuring that class members are only accessed and manipulated through well-defined interfaces (public methods) while keeping internal details private. This enhances code maintainability, as the class can safely change its internal implementation without affecting external code that relies on the public interface.

By using protected access, you can also control the visibility of members within subclasses, promoting proper inheritance and ensuring that derived classes can access and use the appropriate members.
