# Constructors and Methods

In TypeScript, constructors and methods play vital roles in defining classes and shaping the behavior of objects. Constructors are special methods responsible for initializing class properties when an instance of the class is created. Methods on the other hand, are functions defined within the class that can perform various operations or provide functionality related to the class.

## Constructors

Constructors are defined using the `constructor` keyword within the class. When you create a new instance of the class using the `new` keyword, the constructor is automatically executed, allowing you to set up the initial state of the object.

Here's an example of a class with a constructor, focusing on candy bars:

```typescript
class CandyBar {
    // Class properties
    name: string;
    flavor: string;
    weight: number;

    // Constructor
    constructor(name: string, flavor: string, weight: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.flavor = flavor;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CandyBar` class has three properties: `name`, `flavor`, and `weight`. The constructor takes three parameters, `name`, `flavor`, and `weight`, and assigns them to the respective properties of the class.

To create an instance of the `CandyBar` class, you pass the required arguments to the constructor:

```typescript
// Create instances of the CandyBar class
const candyBar1 = new CandyBar('Snickers', 'Chocolate', 50);
const candyBar2 = new CandyBar('KitKat', 'Wafer', 42);
```

Now, `candyBar1` and `candyBar2` are two instances of the `CandyBar` class, each with its own `name`, `flavor`, and `weight` properties.

## Methods

Methods are functions that are part of the class and can operate on class properties or provide specific functionalities related to the class. They are defined within the class scope and can be accessed through class instances.

Let's add a method to the `CandyBar` class that allows the candy bar to describe itself:

```typescript
class CandyBar {
    // Class properties
    name: string;
    flavor: string;
    weight: number;

    // Constructor
    constructor(name: string, flavor: string, weight: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.flavor = flavor;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    // Class method to describe the candy bar
    describe() {
        console.log(`This is a ${this.name} candy bar with a ${this.flavor} flavor and weighs ${this.weight} grams.`);
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we've added the `describe()` method to the `CandyBar` class. When called on an instance of the class, this method will output a message describing the candy bar with its name, flavor, and weight.

## Using Constructors and Methods

To use constructors and methods, you create instances of the class and call the methods on those instances:

```typescript
// Create instances of the CandyBar class
const candyBar1 = new CandyBar('Dairy Milk', 'Chocolate', 50);
const candyBar2 = new CandyBar('KitKat', 'Wafer', 42);

// Call class methods
candyBar1.describe(); // Output: This is a Dairy Milk candy bar with a Chocolate flavor and weighs 50 grams.
candyBar2.describe(); // Output: This is a KitKat candy bar with a Wafer flavor and weighs 42 grams.
```

In this code snippet, we create two instances of the `CandyBar` class, `candyBar1` and `candyBar2`, and call the `describe()` method on each instance to describe the candy bars.

Constructors and methods are essential building blocks of classes in TypeScript. Constructors initialize the object's state, while methods enable objects to perform actions and expose functionality. Understanding and utilizing constructors and methods are crucial steps in developing effective and organized TypeScript applications. Keep exploring and enhancing your TypeScript skills to build more sophisticated and feature-rich classes for your projects. Enjoy your candy bar adventures and happy coding!
